# C-Nano-Playground

## Description
C implementation on an ATmega328P-based Nano boards. This project provides a foundation for developing C programs that run on Arduino Nano boards using the ATmega328P microcontroller.

## Prerequisites
- AVR-GCC toolchain
- AVRDUDE for flashing
- Make build system
- Arduino Nano board with ATmega328P

## Building

Use the Makefile:
```bash
make
```

## Why
This project serves as an educational platform for experimenting with deep microcontroller manipulation, enabling byte-by-byte control of Flash, EEPROM, and SRAM.
